Title : Fundamentals in Neuro Data Science
===========================================

Key words: teaching, mcgill, open data science, neuroscience

Syllabus:
-----------

Neuroscientists rely increasingly on data accessible online and on data science
procedures for their investigations. Data science now offers a key set of
tools and methods to efficiently analyse, visualize and interpret neuroscience
data. Concurrently, there is a growing concern in the life sciences that many
results produced are difficult or even impossible to reproduce. This is
referred to as the reproducibility crisis, which concerns most of biomedical
fields [F. Collin].

This first week of the computational neuroscience seminar series is bringing
together software and analytical tools and methods.  It will teach students how
to best use the fundamentals of data science in their daily work to produce
reproducible results. We will take examples in neuroimaging or imaging
genetics, and see how to use computational tools, statistical and machine
learning techniques, and collaborative and open science methodology to generate
results that are statistically solid and computationally reproducible. While a
large part of this course is language agnostic, we will teach and use python
throughout the course. Students will start to work on projects that they will
continue during the following  computational neuroscience seminar weeks.

The course will require that you have basic programming experience and one or more
undergraduate course(s) in statistical analysis (or equivalent experience),
but it will be aimed at life scientists
(neurologists, psychiatrists, pyschologists, neuroscientists) who wish to
improve their research practices, or students who want an introduction to
data science with examples in neuroscience and neuroimaging.

The first week, outlined below, can be conceptually divided into three sections:

- Part I: Introduction and Motivation  
- Part II: Reproducibility and Data Management Tools  
- Part III: Data analysis: concept and tools
